        <p class="lead mb-4">My job experiences include working in a restaurant for three years over the course of high school and college. As a server and a hostess, I served breakfast, lunch, and dinner to 50-100 customers, as well as answered over 25 phone calls each shift. Along with this, I answered any inquiries the customers may have had about the food or the establishment by memorizing over 40 menu items in order to accommodate for any guests that required special or replaced items. I also resolved any conflicts to ensure customer satisfaction 100% of the time. As a server and a hostess, I warmly greeted new and returning customers and developed new relationships resulting in customer loyalty, and maintained strict and up-to-date cleanliness to ensure both customer satisfaction and employee safety.<br><br>

        Currently, I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside as an Undeclared Major, going into the Sociology Department with a concentration of Data Analytics. As a student, I maintain approximately 28 hours of lectures, schoolwork, homework, and study hours in order to maintain a GPA of over 3.5. Along with this, I keep up-to-date of any school events and club events in order to connect with other students and expand my connections to create a better future for myself and my peers. As an undergraduate student, I keep track and ensure my grades do not fall below a 3.5 GPA each quarter and make meaningful connections with my professors and teaching assistants for future connections into the workforce. In order to improve academic performace, I also plan for future courses in advance in order to have a detailed schedule and plan for the next three years of university. This plan includes every course I will take, every professor, and will document the amount of units to ensure that I will successfully graduate in three years with the necessary requirements.<br><br>

        I have taken part in an internship known as the "Stop Asian Hate Youth Group Campaign" in order to participate in a campaign designed and motivated to promote the movement Stop Asian Hate. As an intern, my motive was to promote the prevention of Asian hate crimes due to the increasing statistics as a result of COVID-19. As an intern, I provided a list of meaningful candidates, interviewed 15 people to raise awareness, created multiple presentations, as well as provided resources to those in need in order to prevent Asian hate crimes from increasing globally. I also attended multiple presentations hosted by other interns and special guests, such as Jeremy Lin, and dedicated 24 hours weekly to this internship. I was also a part of a group of 5 other interns to provide the other interns with a presentation and spoke in front of 150 other members and guests to provide these resources as well as new ideas on how we can improve the experience other Asians have in our society. I plan to participate and provide more to this organization as another intern again in the future.
